# Ensure model files used by face_detector.py, face_landmarks.py are copied
# The Proctoring-AI repo might contain model files (.pb, .pbtxt, .dat) that these scripts load.
# These model files MUST be present in this build context (./backend) to be copied by `COPY . .`
# And the paths within the Python scripts must correctly reference them (e.g. relative to /app).
# Example: If models are in a `models` subdirectory: COPY models ./models
