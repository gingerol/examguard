## Troubleshooting Reference ðŸ”§

### Common Issues & Solutions

**CORS Errors:**
- Check `FRONTEND_URL` matches frontend domain exactly
- Ensure no trailing slashes in URLs
- Verify backend redeployed after CORS config change

**Database Connection Fails:**
- Verify `MONGO_PRIVATE_URL` is correct
- Check MongoDB service is running
- Review connection string format

**Environment Variables Not Loading:**
- Verify variable names are exact (case-sensitive)
- Check Railway dashboard Variables tab
- Redeploy after adding new variables

**Build Failures:**
- Check build logs in Railway
- Verify all dependencies in package.json/requirements.txt
- Check for syntax errors

**WebSocket Connection Issues:**
- Ensure `REACT_APP_WS_URL` is set correctly
- Check for firewall/proxy blocking WebSockets
- Verify backend WebSocket setup

## Deployment Complete! ðŸŽ‰

When all items are checked:
- [ ] Document final URLs for reference
- [ ] Update repository README with deployment info
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts if needed
- [ ] Schedule regular health checks
- [ ] Plan for backup and scaling strategies
