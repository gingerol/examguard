# Implementation Plan: Admin Multi-Student Dashboard

## 1. Background and Motivation

Currently, the admin interface only allows viewing a historical log of events. For effective real-time proctoring in a school setting, administrators need the ability to monitor multiple students simultaneously. This feature will provide a dashboard view where an admin can see live feeds or key status indicators from several active student sessions. This will enable more proactive identification of potential issues and a better overview of ongoing exams.

The primary motivation is to enhance the real-time monitoring capabilities of ExamGuard for administrators, making it a more powerful tool for overseeing exams with multiple participants.

## 2. Key Challenges and Analysis

*   **Real-time Data Streaming:** Efficiently streaming video/status data from multiple students to a single admin dashboard without overwhelming the server or client.
    *   *Consideration:* WebSockets or server-sent events (SSE) for status updates. Video might be snapshots or low-fps streams to conserve bandwidth.
*   **UI Design for Multiple Feeds:** Designing an intuitive and scalable UI that can display information from multiple students clearly.
    *   *Consideration:* Grid layout, paginated views, or a summary view with drill-down capabilities.
*   **Scalability:** The solution should be designed with scalability in mind, considering potentially many students being monitored.
    *   *Consideration:* Backend architecture needs to handle many concurrent connections and data processing.
*   **Data Aggregation and Prioritization:** How to summarize or highlight critical alerts from multiple students.
    *   *Consideration:* Visual cues for students requiring attention.
*   **Backend API Endpoints:** New API endpoints will be needed to:
    *   Fetch a list of active student sessions for an admin.
    *   Provide data streams/snapshots for specific student sessions.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Ensuring only authorized admins can access this dashboard and view student data. This should align with the existing auth system.
*   **Filtering/Sorting:** Admins might need to filter or sort students (e.g., by those with recent alerts).

## 3. High-level Task Breakdown

1.  **Branch Creation:**
    *   Task: Create a new feature branch named `feature/admin-multi-student-dashboard` from the current `main` or `feature/sound-detection` branch (whichever is more up-to-date with recent UI changes).
    *   Success Criteria: Branch created and pushed to the remote repository.
2.  **Backend - API Design & Development:**
    *   Task 3.1: Design API endpoints for fetching active student sessions and their monitoring data.
        *   Success Criteria: API endpoints defined (e.g., `/api/admin/active_sessions`, `/api/admin/session_data/<session_id>`). Data contracts (request/response formats) specified.
    *   Task 3.2: Implement backend logic to track active student sessions (consider associating them with an exam or monitoring period).
        *   Success Criteria: Backend can identify and list students who are currently being "monitored".
    *   Task 3.3: Implement backend logic to serve summarized monitoring data (e.g., latest status, alert count, periodic image snapshot) for a given student session.
        *   Success Criteria: Endpoints return relevant data for active sessions.
    *   Task 3.4: Implement WebSocket or SSE mechanism for pushing real-time updates/alerts from student sessions to the admin dashboard.
        *   Success Criteria: Admin client can receive real-time updates.
3.  **Frontend - Dashboard UI Implementation:**
    *   Task 4.1: Design the basic layout for the multi-student dashboard (e.g., a grid of "student cards").
        *   Success Criteria: Mockup or basic HTML/CSS structure for the dashboard view.
    *   Task 4.2: Implement frontend logic to fetch and display active student sessions on the dashboard.
        *   Success Criteria: Dashboard lists active students, perhaps with basic placeholders for their data.
    *   Task 4.3: Implement frontend display for individual student monitoring data within their "card" (e.g., show latest status, webcam snapshot, key alerts).
        *   Success Criteria: Student cards populate with data from the backend.
    *   Task 4.4: Integrate WebSocket/SSE client to update student cards in real-time.
        *   Success Criteria: Student cards reflect live changes and alerts.
    *   Task 4.5: (Optional/Stretch) Add UI controls for filtering or sorting students on the dashboard.
        *   Success Criteria: Admin can filter/sort the displayed student list.
4.  **Testing & Refinement:**
    *   Task 5.1: Unit and integration tests for backend API endpoints.
        *   Success Criteria: Tests pass, good coverage.
    *   Task 5.2: Frontend component tests and end-to-end tests for dashboard functionality.
        *   Success Criteria: Tests pass, UI is responsive and updates correctly.
    *   Task 5.3: Performance testing with simulated multiple student sessions.
        *   Success Criteria: Dashboard remains performant under expected load.
    *   Task 5.4: User acceptance testing (UAT) with admin persona.
        *   Success Criteria: Admin confirms usability and functionality.
5.  **Documentation:**
    *   Task 6.1: Update API documentation.
    *   Task 6.2: Document the new dashboard feature for end-users (admins).
